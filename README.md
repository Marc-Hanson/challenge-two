# Simon Says

Lucky Dice is a basic dice rolling game! Once the page loads you will be given a random dice roll between 1 and 6, and the computer opponent will be given the same! Who will win in this game of purest chance? Are you feeling lucky!?

The Lucky Dice site is live and is currently hosted [HERE!](https://marc-hanson.github.io/challenge-one/)

## Features

The game was styled with a feeling for the wild west and gambling in an old timey saloon. The fonts chosen: 'Rye' and 'Smokum' both push that theme as well as a sunset color palette of yellows, oranges and browns.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- Scoreboard
- Event Listeners to allow a click on the dice instead of page refresh.

## Testing

- The website was constantly tested during development using Chrome development tools.
- Javascipt was ran after every new function to ensure it was behaving as intended.
- Website tested in Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge.
- Website was tested across a range of devices including laptops, tablets and mobiles.

### Testing During Development

- A random number variable was created for the player and opponent and tested with 'console.log()'.
- The images were then updated using this result and tested on a 'python3 http.server'.
- The final game was pushed to github and tested on multiple devices, all file paths began with a / which resulted in links between Javascript and CSS pages as well as images to display not working correctly. This was later fixed.

### Validator Testing

- HTML
  - HTML pages passed validation on W3C. <br>
